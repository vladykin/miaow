#summary Playing with Miaow for the first time

=Requirements=

  * PHP 5
  * PEAR with DB package (to be replaced with PDO soon, see [issue:11])
  * MySQL (other databases could work to, but we never tested)
  * PHPUnit 1.3.2, if you want to run the unit tests (to be replaced with PHPUnit 3, see [issue:8])

Most Linux boxes already have all these installed, except PHPUnit. Refer to [http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html PHPUnit installation instructions].

On Windows you may use one of those all-on-one web-server distributions, for example [http://vertrigo.sourceforge.net/ VertrigoServ]. In this case PEAR packages have to be installed manually.


=Getting Miaow=
