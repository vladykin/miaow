Miaow is a reworked and improved version of the content management system
(CMS) originally developed for http://rain.ifmo.ru/cat/ website.

A thorough redesign of the current CMS is required to get rid of its
drawbacks and implement some important features.

Current system problems:
- system is rigid and can't be easily extended,
- site management mode is very user-unfriendly,
- executable code is mixed with presentation HTML.

Miaow is to solve these problems. It will also provide two
currently missing but highly desired features:
- site search system,
- article dependency analysis
  (or integration with applications that do).

Project priorities are quality and standards compliance.
